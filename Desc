This Script runs domains from a CSV through various WHo is checks to aid with Domain intel
It outputs a CSV with the selected outputs linked to the domain
Explanation:
defang(): This function converts defanged domains back to their normal form.

whois_check(): This function performs the WHOIS lookup and returns the creation date and registrar. If there's an error (e.g., the domain doesn't exist), it returns "N/A".

process_csv(): This function reads the input CSV, processes each domain, and writes the output to a new CSV file with columns for the domain, creation date, and registrar.

If you want to add more Who is checks you have to modify the whois_check() and the process_csv() parts of the Code

For the whois_check() you have to create the necessary variables using the whois format

For the process_csv() part is it just adding the new fields to the CSV handling following the format used.
